#Definition file for MAC Addresses
#the # symbol designates comments.
#Domain designates the total domain to work in.  It must
#be larger than the total number of MAC addresses.
#This, then, is the domain within which statistical chance may
#be assigned to MAC addresses.  For example, the default is
#to have a domain of 100.  This implies operating within
#1 and 100 to assign probabilities to each MAC address.
#obviously, the probabilities should not sum to more than
#the domain
domain = 100

#MAC addresses are defined by the address = percent.
#The MAC Address may be defined by any number of octets up to
#6 (the maximum).  Any non-specified octets will be randomly
#generated.  All randomly generated octets come after designated
#octets have been processed.
#
#Examples:
#
#The following would designate 32% of all generated MAC addresses
#with the first 3 bytes 00E0B0.  The remaining three bytes would be
#randomly generated.
#00E0B0 = 32
#
#The following designates a secondary format for the MAC address.  Further
#it would set the first 4 bytes of 10% of the MAC addresses generated.
#Note, the quoted probabilities assume a domain of 100.
#0x00 0x80 0x5A 0x12 = 10
